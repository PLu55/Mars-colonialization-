Version r0.1

## Story

### Introduction

A project with the purpose of colonize Mars has been started and the colonization has begun. A small groupe of people has landed
on the planet. A a modular habitat is built from the vessels the people arrived in and some additional module from a some cargo vessels.


In the long run about 160 people are living on the planet. The population lives in 12 habitats. The habitats are specialized on different tasks such as food production, infrastructure support, mining ...

There are problems, the population if devided into faction struggling for power. You have been there in the last convoy. Your secret mission is to unite the population but you have a chose, struggle for the power you self or truly unite the colony.

## Climate

Mars' elliptical orbit significantly affects the amount of solar energy the planet receives throughout its year. Here's a detailed explanation of these effects:
Mars' Elliptical Orbit

* Eccentricity: Mars has an orbital eccentricity of about 0.0934, meaning its orbit around the Sun is more elliptical than Earth's (which has an eccentricity of about 0.0167).
* Perihelion and Aphelion:
        Perihelion: Mars is closest to the Sun at approximately 206.7 million kilometers (1.38 AU) from the Sun.
        Aphelion: Mars is farthest from the Sun at approximately 249.2 million kilometers (1.66 AU) from the Sun.

### Effects on Solar Energy

* Variation in Solar Energy:
    When Mars is at perihelion, it receives about 40% more solar energy than at aphelion.
    This variation causes significant differences in temperature and weather patterns between the two points in its orbit.

* Seasonal Differences:
    Southern Hemisphere: Experiences more extreme seasons because perihelion occurs during the southern summer and aphelion during the southern winter. This leads to hotter summers and colder winters compared to the northern hemisphere.
    Northern Hemisphere: Has milder seasons, as aphelion occurs during the northern summer and perihelion during the northern winter.

* Solar Power Generation:
    Solar panels and other solar energy systems will need to be designed to handle the fluctuations in solar intensity.
    Energy storage solutions might be required to ensure a stable power supply during periods of lower solar energy.

* Agricultural Planning:
    The variation in solar energy impacts growing seasons and crop yields. Agriculture might need to adapt to periods of higher and lower solar radiation.

## Received Solar Energy

To compute the solar energy received at a particular location on Mars, you need to consider several factors, including the distance of Mars from the Sun, the angle of the sunlight (solar zenith angle), the Martian atmosphere, and the time of year. Here's a step-by-step process to compute the solar irradiance (solar power per unit area) at a specific location on Mars:
Step-by-Step Process

    Determine the Solar Constant for Mars
        The solar constant is the amount of solar energy received per unit area at the top of Mars' atmosphere when Mars is at an average distance from the Sun (1 AU). For Earth, the solar constant is approximately 1361 W/m².
        For Mars, the average distance from the Sun is about 1.52 AU. Therefore, the solar constant for Mars SMSM​ can be calculated using the inverse square law:
        SM=1361 W/m2(1.52)2≈589 W/m2
        SM​=(1.52)21361 W/m2​≈589 W/m2

    Account for the Orbital Position (Distance from the Sun)
        Mars' distance from the Sun varies due to its elliptical orbit. The distance dd can be expressed in Astronomical Units (AU).
        At perihelion (closest approach, 1.38 AU) and aphelion (farthest distance, 1.66 AU):
        SM(d)=589 W/m2×(1 AUd)2
        SM​(d)=589 W/m2×(d1 AU​)2

    Calculate the Solar Zenith Angle
        The solar zenith angle θθ is the angle between the vertical direction and the line to the Sun. It depends on the latitude, the time of year, and the time of day.
        For simplicity, at noon on the equator during an equinox, the solar zenith angle is zero (Sun is directly overhead).

    Compute the Solar Irradiance at the Surface
        The irradiance II at the surface can be calculated by accounting for the cosine of the solar zenith angle and atmospheric effects (simplified here):
        I=SM(d)×cos⁡(θ)
        I=SM​(d)×cos(θ)
        Atmospheric effects and dust storms can reduce the irradiance. A transmission factor TT can be introduced:
        I=SM(d)×cos⁡(θ)×T
        I=SM​(d)×cos(θ)×T
        TT can vary based on atmospheric conditions. On a clear day, TT might be around 0.8 to 0.9.

Example Calculation

    Solar Constant for Mars:
        SM≈589 W/m2SM​≈589 W/m2

    Distance from the Sun:
        Let’s calculate for perihelion (1.38 AU):
        SM(1.38)=589×(11.38)2≈309 W/m2
        SM​(1.38)=589×(1.381​)2≈309 W/m2

    Solar Zenith Angle:
        At noon on the equator during an equinox: θ=0θ=0
        cos⁡(θ)=1cos(θ)=1

    Surface Irradiance:
        Assuming T=0.85T=0.85 for clear atmospheric conditions:
        I=309×1×0.85≈263 W/m2
        I=309×1×0.85≈263 W/m2

This example shows that at perihelion, with the Sun directly overhead and clear conditions, the solar irradiance on Mars would be approximately 263 W/m². Adjustments for actual zenith angles and atmospheric conditions at different times and locations would modify this value.
Conclusion

Computing the solar energy at a specific location on Mars involves considering the varying distance from the Sun, the angle of solar incidence, and atmospheric conditions. By using the provided formulas and adjusting for specific conditions, you can estimate the solar energy available at any given location and time on Mars.
